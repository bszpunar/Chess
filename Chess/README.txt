If u want play do this:

1. Open Chess/src/Game/GameStart.java

2. Choose side and next if u want create game you need to write only port,
and if u want join to existed game write ip address and port.


Of course first you have to compile all classes by command 'javac (classname).java' and then you can enjoy playing!
